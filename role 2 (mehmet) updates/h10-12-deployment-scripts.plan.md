# **H10-12: Deployment Scripts - Plan & Outcome**

## **Objective**
Create a set of automated scripts to handle the deployment, funding, and verification of the smart contract on the Algorand TestNet, as required by the project's technical stack and user flow (PRD §5, §7).

---

## **PRD Alignment Review**

-   **[V] Tech Stack:** Scripts were built using Python and `algokit-utils`, aligning with the specified stack (PRD §7).
-   **[V] Network:** All scripts are configured to use the Algorand TestNet, as required for the hackathon MVP (PRD §7).
-   **[V] Contract Funding:** The `deploy_testnet.py` script automatically funds the contract with 0.5 ALGO, satisfying the minimum balance buffer requirement (PRD §6.3).
-   **[V] Automation:** The scripts provide a reliable, automated way to deploy and manage the contract, which is a foundational requirement for the backend and CI/CD processes.

---

## **Implementation & Artifacts**

Three scripts were created in the `projects/AlgoFreelance-contracts/scripts/` directory:

1.  **`deploy_testnet.py`**
    -   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    -   **Function:** Compiles, deploys, and funds the contract on TestNet. It also generates a `deployment-info.json` file with the `app_id` and `app_address`.

2.  **`fund_contract.py`**
    -   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    -   **Function:** A utility script to manually send a specified amount of ALGO to the contract address, useful for testing and top-ups.

3.  **`verify_deployment.py`**
    -   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    -   **Function:** Reads the `deployment-info.json` file and verifies on-chain that the application exists and its account balance is sufficient.

---

## **Conclusion**

Task H10-12 is complete. The created scripts provide the necessary infrastructure for robust and repeatable deployments, fully aligning with the PRD's requirements for a TestNet-based MVP.
