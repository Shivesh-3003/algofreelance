# **H12-15: Testing & Deployment Documentation - Plan & Outcome**

## **Objective**
Create comprehensive documentation for the testing and deployment procedures to ensure all team members can run, validate, and deploy the smart contract consistently. This aligns with the PRD's focus on a high-quality, well-documented project (PRD §11, §14).

## **PRD Alignment Review**

-   **[V] Test Coverage Goal:** The `tests/README.md` provides explicit instructions on how to run tests and generate coverage reports, directly supporting the PRD's goal of 100% test coverage (PRD §11).
-   **[V] Setup Instructions:** The `DEPLOYMENT.md` file serves as the step-by-step setup guide required by the submission checklist (PRD §14), detailing environment setup and script usage.
-   **[V] Risk Mitigation:** Clear documentation on testing and deployment helps mitigate the risk of contract bugs and failed deployments, a key concern outlined in the risk table (PRD §11).

## **Implementation & Artifacts**

Two documentation files were created in the `projects/AlgoFreelance-contracts/` directory:

1.  **`tests/README.md`**
    -   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    -   **Content:** Explains the testing framework (`pytest`, `algokit`), provides commands for running tests and checking coverage, and outlines the procedure for adding new tests.

2.  **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**
    -   **Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
    -   **Content:** Details the end-to-end process for deploying the contract to TestNet using the scripts from H10-12. It includes sections on environment setup, troubleshooting common errors, and rollback procedures.

## **Conclusion**

Task H12-15 is complete. The testing and deployment processes are now well-documented, enabling the team to maintain a high standard of quality and ensuring a smooth workflow for integration and delivery. We are fully prepared to move on.
