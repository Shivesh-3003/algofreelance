## The 3-Act Demo Story

### Act 1: The 10,000-ft View (30 seconds)

**[Opening on Dashboard]**

> "Meet Catherine, the CFO of a Fortune 500 company. She's been asked to invest $100M in AI this year, but she has a problem—she's flying blind."

**[Gesture to the screen]**

> "The CFO AI Cockpit changes that. This is her control tower—one screen showing the entire AI portfolio in dollars, not jargon."

**[Point to KPIs at top]**

> "At a glance, she sees: $14.2M in value generated, $9.2M spent, and a 155% ROI. But the real power is in the details."

**[Scroll to portfolio table]**

> "She can see all AI projects—what's scaling, what's in pilot, and most importantly—what's at risk."

---

### Act 2: The Problem - Drill Into the Failing Project (60 seconds)

**[Click on "Gen-AI Legal Review" project]**

> "Catherine notices this red flag: 'Gen-AI Legal Review.' She clicks to investigate."

**[Project detail page loads]**

> "This is where it gets real. Look at this chart."

**[Point to Cost vs. Value line chart]**

> "The orange line—spend—has climbed to $500,000 over six months. But the green line—value—is flat at zero. Not a single dollar of return."

**[Scroll to Business Metrics]**

> "The business metrics tell the story: User adoption is 3%. The AI isn't being used."

**[Scroll to AI Insight box - RED]**

> "And here's the game-changer. This is an AI-powered insight, generated by analyzing the project's financial and operational data."

**[Read the insight]**

> "**'This project is 95% likely to fail its 6-month ROI goal.'** The reason? User adoption is 3%, and the core business metric—review time—hasn't improved. The recommendation: **Pause funding immediately. Re-allocate the remaining $250k budget to a high-ROI project.**"

**[Pause for effect]**

> "This is the moment Catherine stops the bleeding. No guesswork. No spreadsheets. Just clarity."

### Act 3: The Action - Show the Winning Project (60 seconds)

**[Click back to dashboard]**

> "Now, contrast that with what success looks like."

**[Click on "AP Invoice Automation" project]**

> "Catherine clicks on 'AP Invoice Automation,' a project marked as 'Scaling.'"

**[Project detail page loads]**

> "Look at this chart. Spend is $1.2M, but value has skyrocketed to $4.5M. That's a 375% ROI."

**[Point to metrics]**

> "The metrics are stellar: 98% adoption rate. The team is processing 1,200 invoices per hour with near-zero errors."

**[Scroll to AI Insight box - GREEN]**

> "And the AI insight confirms it."

**[Read the insight]**

> "**'Project has exceeded annual goals by 50%.'** The recommendation: **Scale this solution. AI analysis suggests deploying it to 'Procurement' and 'Logistics' could generate an additional $2M in value.**"

**[Pause]**

> "This is proactive finance. Catherine doesn't just see the ROI—she sees the roadmap to scale it."

---

### Closing: The Pitch (30 seconds)

**[Click back to dashboard]**

> "The CFO AI Cockpit solves the AI Experimentation Trap. It stops the guessing game and gives finance leaders what they need: **transparency, control, and a clear line from AI spend to P&L impact.**"

**[Final screen: Dashboard with all projects visible]**

> "This is the one screen Catherine uses to answer the board's toughest question: **'What is the financial ROI of our AI spend?'**"

**[Pause, look at judges]**

> "Thank you. We're ready for questions."

## Key Talking Points (If Asked)

### How does the AI Insight work?
> "For this MVP, the insights are hard-coded to demonstrate the UX. In production, this would integrate with a real AI model (like Claude or GPT-4) that analyzes project data—spend, adoption rates, business metrics—and generates financial recommendations in real-time."

### What makes this different from a BI dashboard?
> "Traditional BI dashboards show charts. This shows **decisions**. The AI Insight component doesn't just present data—it tells the CFO what to *do* with it: pause, scale, or pivot. That's the innovation."

### Is this only for CFOs?
> "CFOs are the primary user, but VPs of AI, CTOs, and Program Managers can use it to justify budgets, prioritize projects, and demonstrate value to leadership."

### What data sources does it support?
> "The MVP uses a static JSON file to prove the concept. In production, this would connect to existing tools: ERP systems (SAP, Oracle), project management platforms (Jira, Asana), and financial systems (NetSuite, Workday)."

### Can it handle 100+ projects?
> "Absolutely. The architecture is designed to scale. We'd add pagination, search, and advanced filtering for large portfolios."

### What's next for this product?
> "Phase 1: Real-time data integration with APIs. Phase 2: Predictive analytics—forecast project ROI based on early signals. Phase 3: Automated alerts—notify the CFO the moment a project goes off track."

## Visual Cues to Emphasize

1. **The "Flat Line"** - When showing the failing project, emphasize the visual contrast between rising spend and flat value
2. **The Red Box** - The AI Insight component in red is the "emergency alert"
3. **The Green Line Soaring** - When showing the winning project, point to the steep upward trajectory of value
4. **The Green Box** - The AI Insight component in green is the "success signal"

## Backup Slides (If Needed)

### Problem Statement
- CFOs invest $X billion in AI annually
- 70% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI
- No standard framework for measuring AI value

### Market Opportunity
- Every Fortune 500 company has a CFO
- TAM: Enterprise AI spend = $500B+ globally
- ICP: CFOs, VPs of Finance, AI Program Directors

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Recharts
- Data: JSON (MVP) → API (Production)
- AI: Claude/GPT-4 for insight generation

### Competitive Landscape
- **vs. Traditional BI (Tableau, Power BI):** We're decision-focused, not just data visualization
- **vs. Project Management (Jira, Asana):** We're financial-ROI focused, not task tracking
- **vs. AI Observability (DataRobot, Domino):** We're business value, not model performance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don't spend too long on the dashboard—get to the failing project quickly
❌ Don't skip reading the AI Insight text—it's the climax
❌ Don't forget to show the contrast (failing vs. winning project)
❌ Don't go over 3 minutes—judges will lose attention

---

## Pro Tips

✅ Rehearse the demo 10+ times before presenting
✅ Use a wireless mouse/clicker to avoid touching the laptop
✅ Stand to the side of the screen, not in front
✅ Make eye contact with judges when delivering key lines
✅ Pause after the AI Insight reveal—let it land
✅ Keep energy high—this is a story, not a feature list
