"""
Edge Cases & Invalid State Transition Tests (H2-6 Task 4)

Tests for edge cases, boundary conditions, and invalid state transitions.

Covers scenarios from PRD §6.3 (Minimum Balance Requirements) and §11 (Risk Mitigation):
- Invalid state transitions
- Double operations (double approval, double submission)
- Minimum balance requirements
- Boundary value testing (empty strings, very large numbers, etc.)
- Special characters and Unicode handling
- Multi-contract independence

Job Status State Machine (PRD §6.1):
0 = Created (contract deployed, not funded)
1 = Funded (client sent payment to contract)
2 = Submitted (freelancer submitted work)
3 = Completed (client approved, payment + NFT sent)

Valid transitions:
0 → 1 (funding)
1 → 2 (submit_work)
2 → 3 (approve_work)

Invalid transitions (tested here):
0 → 2, 0 → 3, 1 → 3, etc.
