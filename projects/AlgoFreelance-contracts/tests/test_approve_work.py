"""
Approve Work Method Tests (H2-6 Task 3) ⭐ CRITICAL

Tests for the approve_work() method with grouped inner transactions.

THIS IS THE CORE INNOVATION OF THE PROJECT (PRD §6.2 lines 242-289)

Based on PRD §6.2:
When client approves work, the smart contract AUTONOMOUSLY executes THREE
inner transactions in a SINGLE ATOMIC GROUP:

1. Inner Txn 1 (Payment): Transfer escrow_amount to freelancer
2. Inner Txn 2 (Asset Config): Mint Proof-of-Work NFT with:
   - total: 1 (unique NFT)
   - decimals: 0
   - name: "AlgoFreelance: " + job_title
   - unit_name: "POWCERT"
   - url: work_hash (IPFS link)
   - NO manager/freeze/clawback addresses (immutable)
3. Inner Txn 3 (Asset Transfer): Send NFT to freelancer

ATOMICITY GUARANTEE: All 3 succeed together OR all 3 fail together.

Workflow Context:
1. initialize() - Contract created (status = 0)
2. Client funds contract → status = 1
3. submit_work() - Freelancer submits IPFS hash → status = 2
4. approve_work() - Client approves → INNER TXNS → status = 3
