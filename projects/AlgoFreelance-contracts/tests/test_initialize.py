Initialize Method Tests (H2-6 Task 1)

Tests for the initialize() method that sets up a new escrow contract.

Based on PRD §6.2 lines 222-230:
- Sets client_address, freelancer_address, escrow_amount, job_title
- Sets job_status = 0 (Created)
- Records created_at timestamp
- Only callable by contract creator
- Validates escrow_amount > 0

Global State Schema (PRD §6.1):
- client_address: Bytes (32 bytes)
- freelancer_address: Bytes (32 bytes)
- escrow_amount: UInt64 (microALGOs)
- job_status: UInt64 (0=Created, 1=Funded, 2=Submitted, 3=Completed)
- work_hash: Bytes (IPFS CID, 46-59 bytes)
- job_title: Bytes (max 64 bytes)
- created_at: UInt64 (Unix timestamp)
