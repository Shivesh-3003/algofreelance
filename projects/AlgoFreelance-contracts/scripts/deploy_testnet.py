"""
Automated TestNet deployment script for the AlgoFreelance smart contract.

This script performs the following actions:
- Loads environment variables from the .env.testnet file.
- Compiles the PyTeal smart contract.
- Deploys the contract to the Algorand TestNet.
- Funds the newly created contract account with 0.5 ALGO.
- Saves the App ID and address to a 'deployment-info.json' file.
- Generates and prints a block explorer link for the deployed application.
