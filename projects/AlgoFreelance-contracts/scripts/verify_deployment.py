"""
Utility script to verify the deployment of the AlgoFreelance contract.

This script checks if the contract specified in 'deployment-info.json' is correctly
deployed and funded on the Algorand TestNet.

It performs the following checks:
- Reads the 'deployment-info.json' file for the App ID.
- Queries the Algod client for the application's information.
- Verifies that the application exists.
- Checks if the application account's balance is sufficient (>= 0.5 ALGO).
